## p5js-savedrawings

This repository was created in order to teach people how you can save a drawing using p5js. :fireworks:

It's easy to follow and is really usefull. 

Draw an image and store it as an variable and then make it downloadable as a json. Pretty simple project which only takes about 10 minutes to complete!
